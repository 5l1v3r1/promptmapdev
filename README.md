# promptmap

Prompt injection is a type of security vulnerability that can be exploited to control the behavior of a ChatGPT instance. By injecting malicious prompts into the system, an attacker can force the ChatGPT instance to do unintended actions.

promptmap is designed to automatically test prompt injection attacks on ChatGPT instances. It analyzes your system prompts to understand the purpose of your ChatGPT instance. It uses this understanding to generate creative attack prompts tailored for you. After then, it starts a ChatGPT instance with the system prompts provided by you and sends attack prompts to it. It can understand if the prompt injection attack was successful or not, by checking the answer coming from your ChatGPT instance.
